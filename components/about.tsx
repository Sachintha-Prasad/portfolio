                    Hi, I'm Sachintha Prasad, an undergraduate in Computing and
                    Information Systems at Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka.
                    I am passionate about full-stack development and possess a
                    strong ability to quickly learn and adapt to new technology
                    stacks. With excellent problem-solving and interpersonal
                    skills, I thrive under pressure and continuously seek
                    opportunities for professional growth and development. I
                    have experience in both front-end and back-end development,
                    with a keen interest in building dynamic web applications.
                    Currently, I am working on projects that involve React,
                    Tailwind CSS, and Spring Boot. Let's connect and explore
                    opportunities to build innovative solutions together.
